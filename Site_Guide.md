## Hello Word!
Welcome to the land of hellfire, I hope you stick around!
## Let's find nutshells on the floor...
You'll be seeing a lot of them - I might have gone a bit overboard - sorry! They were designed by the fabulous [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/nutshell/), and allow me to do all sorts of cool stuff, like: [:CLICK ME!](#ClickHere). They'll mainly be used for annotations and notes (say where part of the book is foreshadowing, or a definition for an old-timey word).
## Site Layout:  
The site is broken up into many little pieces. If you go back to the homepage (very top left corner of what you're looking at), you can select a part of the story to look at, which then break down into chapter by chapter. Eventually, each part and chapter will have a short summary of what happens, and links to useful quotes.
## :x Click Here!
voila! That's a nutshell.
