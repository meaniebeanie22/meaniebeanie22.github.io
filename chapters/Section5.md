## A short summary...
In this part we hear of Jim's escapades with the *Hispaniola* as it was under sail by the mutineers. He finds Ben Gunn's [:coracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coracle), and uses it to board and capture the *Hispaniola*, and beach it around the north of the island. He has many interactions with Israel Hands whilst aboard, with the result being that Jim is minorly injured, and Israel is dead as a rock. This part serves two purposes - to create intensity for the finding of the treasure, and to add some more depth to a wide range of characters, especially Jim and Israel.
