## A short summary...
In this part, Steveson takes the reader on a journey through the bushes of the island, whilst illustrating the heinous acts of LJS against his crew that were taken ashore. We are shown his true ways and beliefs, and also shown how he and Flint's crew have not changed since they were last on Treasure Island, with Ben Gunn being a living example of the extent they were wiolling to go to to punish those for even the smallest of wrongdoings.
