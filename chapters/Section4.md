## A short summary...
In this section we hear of many things, but the main events are that the faithful men have abandoned ship with some supplies, and taken up residence in a [:stockade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockade) on the island. Close to the end of the chapter we learn of the situation the mutineers are in, and a war ends up breaking out between the faithful men and the mutineers, resulting in many people being killed form both sides (there are now only 4 faithful men and 8 mutineers - better odds than before for the faithfuls, but still a massive loss).
