## A short summary...
This is the final section of the novel, and as such contains much of the action and suspense. We come to the realisation that the treasure isn't in the cache anymore, and that Ben Gunn has already excavated it and moved it to his cave. Stevenson uses this section to bring the story to the close and give the reader a sense of accomplishment as they feel that those who they supported (almost always the faithful men) have succeeded in their mission. While the story contains a lot of death and fighting, the ending is particularly violent as the pirates (who are already at their wits end) are met with no treasure at all. This finishes off the plot, and all that is left is the resolution and tying up loose ends of the novel.
