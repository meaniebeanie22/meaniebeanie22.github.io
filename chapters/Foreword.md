## What is this?  
Simple - a guide. Crucial events will almost always be linked to in their part's summary (with quotations where they occur), and main characters and analysis will be linked where they're found. Each chapter and part also has a summary, it'd be a good idea to read through them first, as they contain a condensed version of the same analysis you'll see in the chapter.
## Why?  
It's useful as a resource - quick, concise reference material for each part of the novel available anywhere.
