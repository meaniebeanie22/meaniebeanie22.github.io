## A short summary...
This section introduces many of the main characters of the novel, including Jim, Dr Livesey, and others. This section culminates in Bill ('The Old Sea Dog at the 'Admiral Benbow'') dying form a stroke, and Jim taking some money and an oilskin pouch, which ends up containing detailed records of his and a treasure map that used to belong to Captain Flint (An infamous pirate in the novel). Bill brings nothing short of hell upon the Inn when he dies, as his old shipmates rush the Inn in an attempt to recover the map, but all tat is left is some of his gold. Stevenson uses this section to kickstart the novel, and hook the reader into the sea of adventures that lay in the novel, with waves of climax and calm throughout each part.
